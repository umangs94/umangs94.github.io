                    <h2>About me</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    I love collecting and analyzing how all my personal data (including fitness, nutrition, sleep,
                    location history, and more) interact with one another. To that end, my personal goal is to improve
                    everyoneâ€™s daily lives by combining all their data and helping them make sense of it. To pursue this
                    goal further, I am studying Computer Science (with a focus on Machine Learning) in the Master
                    of Engineering program at UC Berkeley.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over Summer 2019, I interned at an early-stage startup as a Machine Learning Intern and worked on
                    developing classification models using computer vision techniques in TensorFlow 2. I used transfer
                    learning on many models including InceptionV3 and ResNet-152. Along the way, I scraped for images
                    and created a video annotation tool using opencv2. I also generated 40k randomized simulated
                    images for training after learning to use Blender.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The MEng program focuses extensively on technical leadership in the industry and so, I am taking
                    courses about Machine Learning, Deep RL, and ML Systems. In Fall 2019, I am researching traffic
                    light coordination using Deep RL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2017, I published an iOS app called Drinks Tracker on the App Store based on an observation that
                    I made a couple of years ago during my undergraduate years at The Ohio State University. In early
                    2018, I was working on integrating drink suggestions using machine learning in my app (to
                    automatically suggest drinks to users based on their preferences and drink history) when Apple
                    removed this category of apps from the App Store.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My current fitness goal is to complete a 7.5 mile run in an hour. Currently, I am two minutes away
                    from making it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies and TV, especially science fiction classics such as Star
                    Trek and Doctor Who. ðŸ––
                </p>
                <p>
                    After I graduate in December 2019, I want to work as a Machine Learning Engineer, ideally in the Bay
                    Area, to make better use of all the data that we generate every day.
